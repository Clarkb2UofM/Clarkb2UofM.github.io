By Ben Clark

---
#### Purpose
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to host your own resume on github pages. 

For this tutorial, we will be using documents formatted with Markdown language.
Andrew Etter, author of the best selling book _Modern Technical Writing_, reccomends the use of markdown for technical doccuments because of it is lightweight, easy to learn and universially used. 

#### Prerequisites
Before beginning, you should have the following:
- A resume in markdown format. You can find a tutorial on how to use markdown [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
- An account on GitHub. If you do not have an account, you can create one [here](https://github.com/signup)

#### Terminology
Throughout this tutorial, a number of terms are used that may not be accesible to all users. To remedy this, I have descibed them here:
- Repository: A repository is place to store files online

### Step 1 - Creating a Repository
The first thing that will need to be done to host your resume online is to set up your github account. In order to store your resume online, you will need a repository, (a place online to store your files)
1. Sign into your account on [Github](https://github.com/)
2. Click the green button labeled new on the left hand side of the screen

This will take you to the **Create a new repository** page, from here we can continue

3. Enter ``` username.github.io ``` into the repository name feild (where username is your username on GitHub)

Naming your repository in this way lets Github know that you want to create a website from this repository

4. Click the checkbox next to _Add a README file_
5. Lastly click the _Create repository button_ at the bottom of your screen. 

Your repo is now setup and ready for use.

At this point in the tutorial, your site can already be viewed. 
Navigate to ``` https://YourUserName.github.io/ ```
Currently, the only thing displayed will be the default Reame.md that Guthub created for you.
In order to display your resume on the site, you will need to upload files to the repository

### Uploading files to your Repository
Now that the respoitory is set up, the next step is to upload your resume to the repository.
